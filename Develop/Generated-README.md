## Installation
Go to my GitHub profile and then to readme-generator repo. Clone the repo and run the command 'git clone "What-You-Have-Copied-While-Cloning" ' on your command line.


## Usage
On your terminal navigate to the directory/local repo where you have cloned the application. Make sure you can see the index .js  file when you run the ls command. If not, go inside any sub-directory where it lives. Then run node index or node index.js on the command-line, and it will prompt for the user input.


## How to Contribute
Not available as of now!


## Tests
 I tested the application to make sure correct functionality, as I would do for any other application/project. However, I didn't write any test for this application. It wasn't required.
